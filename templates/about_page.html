            <p class="lead">For those who work out at home, finding a good workout routine is difficult. It is hard to constantly have to find workout videos that meet your fitness needs, as well as your time and equipment constraints. Plus, the pre-set workouts found online are not one-size-fits-all. In other words, while there are many workout videos online to choose from, these choices are non-personalized. Our project is a solution that can solve all these problems, as well as meet the growing need for an easy way to build a good at home workout routine during the pandemic.
              <br><br>
              Our project is a workout recommender system web application that recommends workout videos by <a href="https://www.fitnessblender.com/">Fitness Blender</a>. Our website displays several lists of recommendations (similar to Netflix’s user interface), such as “top 5 upper body workouts for you”. Users can login into our website, choose between several models to generate their recommendations, browse through personalized recommendations lists, and choose a workout to do, saving them the time and effort needed to build a good workout routine.
